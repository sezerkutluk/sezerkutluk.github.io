I am mainly interested in the following:
- probabilistic machine learning,
- reliable and trustworthy machine learning,
- explainable AI,
- uncertainty quantification and model calibration,
- causal inference and causal machine learning
- optimization for machine learning
- signal processing
- computer vision
- modeling and processing of time series/signal/image/video/audio/medical data.

Below are more keywords which I find interesting.

Modeling uncertainties
--
- Bayesian deep learning,
- approximate inference,
- likelihood-free inference,
- and nonparametric models.

Uncertainty Quantification and Model Calibration
--
- Distribution free uncertainty quantification,
- model calibration.

Explainable AI
--
- Gradient based explanations,
- perturbation based explanations,
- causal explanations,
- counterfactual explanations,
- and so forth.

Causal Inference and Causal Machine Learning
--
- Causal inference for machine learning,
- causal representation learning,
- machine learning for causal inference,
- causal discovery.

Optimization Methods for Machine Learning
--
- Second order methods,
- regularization techniques.

Machine Learning Applications
--
- Computer vision and image processing,
- Multimedia search and retrieval,
- Audio and musical signal processing,
- Time series prediction, forecasting, etc.,
- Medical data processing (computer aided diagnosis etc.),
- remote sensing and hyperspectral imaging.

Signal Processing
--
- Time-frequency analysis
- Signal decomposition
