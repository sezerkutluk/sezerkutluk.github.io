I am currently working as a research scientist at [Leibniz Institute ATB](https://atb-potsdam.de/) in Potsdam. I am part of the Data Science in Bioeconomy department, and also the [Understandable Machine Intelligence (UMI) Lab.](https://twitter.com/UMI_Lab_AI), working on explainable AI.

I completed my [ERCIM 'Alain Bensoussan' postdoctoral fellowship](https://fellowship.ercim.eu) at [Fraunhofer Institute for Mechatronic Systems Design (IEM)](https://www.iem.fraunhofer.de), Trusted Machine Intelligence Group. This fellowship program is organized by [European Research Consortium for Informatics and Mathematics](https://www.ercim.eu/). I worked on explainable AI with an emphasis on time series models. I was mainly focused on instance-based, post-hoc counterfactual explanations for black-box classification and anomaly detection models.

Previosly, I was an Engineering Manager (in AI Research) & Senior Research Engineer at [Huawei Technologies Turkey R&D Center](https://www.huawei.com/en/).

I got my PhD degree in Electrical-Electronics Engineering from Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa (which was formerly part of Istanbul University). My main research topics are machine learning, signal processing, probabilistic modeling, and computer vision. One research direction I am interested in is trustworthy machine learning via explainable AI and modeling/quantifying uncertainties. Some other keywords are Bayesian inference, probabilistic graphical models, subspace learning and sparse approximations, and image/video/audio processing. I am also interested in causal inference and Bayesian statistics (especially approximate inference, sampling, and likelihood-free inference) though I have a limited understanding in these.

During my PhD I worked on probabilistic models for spectral-spatial classification of hyperspectral images under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Aydın Akan](https://scholar.google.com.tr/citations?user=WSG0eK4AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Dr. Koray Kayabol](https://scholar.google.com.tr/citations?user=lIuXJKEAAAAJ&hl=en). In this problem, a land cover segmentation map is obtained by pixel-wise classification. I developed several generative and discriminative classification models with non-stationary mixture models, random fields, deep learning, subspace learning, and optimization algorithms for machine learning.

I pursued my MSc degree from Istanbul Technical University in Biomedical Engineering under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Bilge Günsel](https://scholar.google.com.tr/citations?user=ZxQ_Pm8AAAAJ&hl=en). My thesis was about tissue density classification in mammographic images using local features. During master's studies I was a member of the [Multimedia Signal Processing and Pattern Recognition Lab.](http://www.mspr.itu.edu.tr) of ITU, and I took part in several projects on image/video modeling, processing, classification, retrieval, fingerprinting, and copy detection.

I got my bachelor's degree in Electrical-Electronics Engineering with an emphasis on telecommunications and signal processing from Istanbul University.

At Huawei, I worked on research projects on machine learning, computer vision, video processing, information retrieval, and learning-to-rank. I also gained some experience in grant applications, patent applications, project management, technical team management, and people management.

Before Huawei, I was a Signal Processing Software Design Engineer at [Netaş Telecommunications](https://netas.com.tr) in Istanbul where I developed embedded signal processing software for satellite navigation.

I have a work experience of almost 14 years (1 year at Fraunhofer, 8 years at Huawei, 2 years at Netaş, 3 years at ITU MSPR Lab.).
