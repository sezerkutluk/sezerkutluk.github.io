## Work Experience

Before joining ATB, I spent 1 year with Fraunhofer, 8 years with Huawei, 2 years with Netaş, and 3 years with ITU MSPR Lab. in reverse chronological order.

- September 2023 - ... : Scientist @ [Leibniz Institute ATB](https://atb-potsdam.de/), Data Science in Bioeconomy Department &  [Understandable Machine Intelligence (UMI) Lab.](https://twitter.com/UMI_Lab_AI). Focus: Explainable AI, trustworthy AI, AI applications in bioeconomy (mostly computer vision).
- April 2022 - March 2023: [ERCIM 'Alain Bensoussan' Fellow](https://fellowship.ercim.eu) @ [Fraunhofer Institute for Mechatronic Systems Design (IEM)](https://www.iem.fraunhofer.de), Trusted Machine Intelligence Group. This fellowship program is organized by [European Research Consortium for Informatics and Mathematics](https://www.ercim.eu/). Focus: Explainable AI with an emphasis on post-hoc and counterfactual explanations for time series models.
- March 2014 - March 2022: Engineering Manager (in AI Research) & (Senior) Research Engineer & Team Leader & Project Manager @ [Huawei Technologies Turkey R&D Center](https://www.huawei.com/en/). Focus: Machine learning, computer vision, video processing, information retrieval, learning-to-rank, grant applications, patent applications, project management, technical team management, and people management.
- June 2012 - February 2014: Signal Processing Software Design Engineer @ [Netaş Telecommunications](https://netas.com.tr). Focus: Embedded signal processing software for satellite navigation.
- July 2009 - May 2012: Researcher @ [Multimedia Signal Processing and Pattern Recognition Lab.](http://www.mspr.itu.edu.tr) of Istanbul Technical University. Focus: Computer vision, image/video modeling, processing, classification, retrieval, fingerprinting, and copy detection.

## Education

- PhD in Electrical-Electronics Engineering from Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa (which was formerly part of Istanbul University).

    My main research topics are machine learning, signal processing, probabilistic modeling, and computer vision. One research direction I am interested in is trustworthy machine learning via explainable AI and modeling/quantifying uncertainties. Some other keywords are Bayesian inference, probabilistic graphical models, subspace learning and sparse approximations, and image/video/audio processing. I am also interested in causal inference and Bayesian statistics (especially approximate inference, sampling, and likelihood-free inference) though I have a limited understanding in these.

    During my PhD I worked on probabilistic models for spectral-spatial classification of hyperspectral images under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Aydın Akan](https://scholar.google.com.tr/citations?user=WSG0eK4AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Dr. Koray Kayabol](https://scholar.google.com.tr/citations?user=lIuXJKEAAAAJ&hl=en). In this problem, a land cover segmentation map is obtained by pixel-wise classification. I developed several generative and discriminative classification models with non-stationary mixture models, random fields, deep learning, subspace learning, and optimization algorithms for machine learning.

- MSc in Biomedical Engineering from Istanbul Technical University under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Bilge Günsel](https://scholar.google.com.tr/citations?user=ZxQ_Pm8AAAAJ&hl=en). My thesis was about tissue density classification in mammographic images using local features.

- Bachelor's in Electrical-Electronics Engineering from Istanbul University with an emphasis on telecommunications and signal processing. Graduation project was real-time music and audio effects on DSP.
